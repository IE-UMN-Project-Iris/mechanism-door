I decided to go with a design that will combine both 3D printed
parts and laser cutted parts. For this reason I included a list
of which part is which. Note that the 3D printed parts will be 
saved as an .stl file and the laser cutted parts will be saved
with as a .dfx file. The parts are as follow:

-Back panel (Laser cutted)
-Doors (Laser cutted)
-Electronics Bay Base (Laser cutted)
-Front panel (Laser cutted)
-Gear (3D Printed)
-Lever (3D Printed)
-Lever Hinge (3D printed)
-Side Supports (laser cutted)
-Supports Bottom (laser cutted)
-Supports Top (laser cutted)
