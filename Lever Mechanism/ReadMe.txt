This is my attempt at a design for the bomb bay mechanism, 
my overall goal was to be able to create a sort of lever
mechanism that would translate the rotating motion of the servo
into a pushing motion that would open and close a pair of 
doors at the bottom of the aircraft. 

Mk1: This was mainly a proof of concept to see if the idea I
had would actually work. The gears are not perfectly matched so
the design mainly works thanks to the gear relation that exists
in solidworks. Also, the dimmensions are not close at all to
the actual dimmensions of the aircraft. This design will work 
as my reference point for the actual prototype with the correct
dimmensions but feel free to look at the parts and assembly to
have an overall idea of how my concept works. 

Mk2: This is my second attempt at approaching the lever 
mechanism using what I learned from Mk1. I will be using a 
combination of both 3D printed parts and laser cutted parts.
Hopefully this should fit in the FT Guinea since I used the 
same dimmensions that were used to create the testing platform.
I included .stl files for both the parts and the final assembly
so you guys can look at it and have an overall idea of how the
concept works.
